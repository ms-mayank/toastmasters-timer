Let me ask you a question

How many of you have children at home?? - a niece/nephew/son/daughter
and How many of you want them to ace/excel, have good grades and do well in their schools/colleges ??

But the important question is not about acing the exam or being topper but the real concern is whether are they going to top in the correct evironment or not?

Ladies & Gentlemen and my dear friends let me tell you the good Traits of Best Factory:

- Need to follow a fixed set of rules and patterns. 
- Not allowed to try anything new, 
- No experiment allowed
- Need to do the same repeated set of procedures over and over.
- Commanding structure - One person will be the supervisor and others have to follow what he says.
- Certain symbols and patterns need to be followed - like - ringing bells; which will tell when to start, when to eat, when to chat, and when to stop.
- Evaluation will be done on how well you have followed that procedure.
- No scope for error and failure.

If it sounds familiar then: yes this is the environment in which we all have been once in a life and currently your brother, sister, child or someone must be going through this environment.

This is our education system

when the Victorians captured almost all continents, they needed a workforce to run their empire that should be systematic, symmetric, and consistent so that they can send them anywhere in the world. Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay designed the system which can mass produce their workforce. It was to benefit his empire not to benefit any individual. 
victorian established their first colony in 1607 from then till today they have stopped capturing land but they never ended up capturing the minds 




In 1922 Thomas Edison mentioned and I quote "The motion picture is destined to revolutionize our educational system and that in a few years, it will supplant largely if not entirely the use of textbooks." 

But is it; does allowing the best technology will change the Education system the way we want?

One day a school organization was worried about their student's performance in science, they decided to do some changes, they hired the best science teachers - nothing changed; they thought the color and small building might be a problem and vastu was not correct so they build new infrastructure; same result; so they went digital, created a graphical representation of the topic using images and videos, bought best computers; implemented Virtual reality; nothing changed; they hired best engineers who developed best AI, ML, and robots to teach science to students. 
and then something happened organization went bankrupt BCS students' results were the same.
and you know why the thing did not changed BCS they were trying to teach science to a student who in reality wanted to study history.


does investing a huge amount of money and bringing the best technology to the table will change everything? are we not in the process of just trying to boast the Victorian mindset instead of finding some other solution
if it is? who will find it out? well in the end everyone is a product of that Factory and the reason which makes it the best factory is that even by knowing all the cons, everyone is in the process of upgrading it.

will this change? - of course
but When? - Nobody knows
